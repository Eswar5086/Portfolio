<!-- EXPERIENCE -->

    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

    <h3>Biliti Electric, United States</h3>
    <p><strong>MLOps Engineer</strong> | Jan 2025 to Present</p>
    <p>
        At Biliti Electric, I work on building and operating end to end MLOps platforms for
        manufacturing and industrial AI use cases. I design automated pipelines using Vertex AI
        and Kubeflow to handle model training, validation, deployment, monitoring, and retraining
        in production environments. I also provision and manage cloud native ML infrastructure
        on Google Cloud using Terraform, which helped reduce deployment issues and improve
        environment consistency. Through automation and standardized CI CD workflows, I was
        able to reduce model release timelines by around 45 percent, honestly making the overall
        ML delivery process faster and more reliable.
    </p>

    <h3>Schneider Electric, United States</h3>
    <p><strong>Data Scientist</strong> | Jun 2021 to Dec 2023</p>
    <p>
        At Schneider Electric, I focused on transitioning machine learning models from research
        driven experimentation into scalable, production ready systems. I collaborated closely
        with data scientists, platform teams, and business stakeholders to productionize models
        using Vertex AI and container based deployments. I also helped establish standards for
        feature engineering, model versioning, evaluation, and monitoring using Kubeflow style
        pipelines. These efforts improved operational adoption of ML solutions by about
        35 percent and increased forecast accuracy by roughly 18 percent across key industrial
        analytics use cases.
    </p>

    <h3>Tetraquark Innovations, India</h3>
    <p><strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> | Dec 2018 to May 2021</p>
    <p>
        At Tetraquark Innovations, I worked on building end to end machine learning solutions,
        covering data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment
        support. I designed reusable ML pipeline components aligned with scalable orchestration
        patterns, which helped accelerate development of new ML use cases. I also supported
        post deployment monitoring and iterative retraining cycles to maintain model performance
        over time. Overall, this work reduced development time by about 30 percent and improved
        model stability by nearly 20 percent.

    <h3>Automated ML Training and Deployment Pipelines</h3>
    <p>
        In this project, I designed and implemented automated machine learning pipelines to
        support end to end model training, testing, deployment, and monitoring. The solution
        leveraged Python, Docker, Vertex AI, and Kubeflow to standardize ML workflows and
        ensure reproducibility across environments. I also implemented CI CD automation and
        Infrastructure as Code using Terraform, which enabled consistent environment setup
        and repeatable deployments. Overall, this approach reduced model release cycles by
        approximately 40 percent and significantly improved reliability of production ML
        workflows.
